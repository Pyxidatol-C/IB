Nick Carraway = first person narrator  
Do we trust him? Is he reliable?

Fitzgerald overcomes the limitations of having a 1st person narrator by: 

- Recounting dialogue between characters
- Direct quotation of another character's account (of a story)
- Paraphrasing another character
- Piecing together fragments of a story in Nick's voice
- Speculation (by Nick) about what a character might have felt
- Inclusion of Stories that Nick could not have witnessed
	- ex: Jordan tells of Daisy's wedding

Opposing viewpoints: 

- Reliable: the sadder, the wiser at the end of the novel; the hero
- clueless at the end of the novel as at the beginning
